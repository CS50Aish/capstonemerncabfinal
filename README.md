Full Stack Capstone Project on Cab Service Application and Booking

## Cab Service Application

### Course-End Project 1

#### Description
The aim of this project is to create a cab booking application for the employees of a multinational company, utilizing the concepts of the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. This application seeks to streamline the cab booking process, making it more efficient and user-friendly by transitioning from an offline to an online system.

### Real-World Scenario
A multinational company has observed a significant decline in the usage of their internal cab service. An internal survey revealed that the current booking process is cumbersome and inefficient, with offline allocation of cabs being tedious and prone to errors. To address these issues, the company desires an online cab booking application to eliminate manual efforts and enhance the booking experience for employees.

### Project Objectives
- Develop a user-friendly online platform for cab booking.
- Streamline the allocation process of cabs to employees.
- Ensure efficient and transparent booking and allocation of cabs.
- Reduce manual efforts and errors in the booking process.

### Technology Stack
- **MongoDB**: For database management, storing user data, cab details, and booking history.
- **Express.js**: As the web application framework for building the backend.
- **React.js**: For creating the frontend user interface.
- **Node.js**: To run the server-side code and manage backend services.

### Key Features
1. **User Authentication**:
   - Employee login and registration.
   - Role-based access control (e.g., admin, employee).

2. **Cab Booking System**:
   - Real-time availability of cabs.
   - Easy-to-use booking interface.
   - Option to book immediate or scheduled rides.

3. **Booking Management**:
   - View, modify, or cancel bookings.
   - Track booking history and ride status.

4. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Manage cab availability and schedules.
   - Monitor bookings and generate reports.
   - Assign drivers to cabs and manage their schedules.

5. **Notifications**:
   - Email and SMS notifications for booking confirmations, cancellations, and ride reminders.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Conduct meetings with stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
   - Create user stories and use cases based on the gathered requirements.

2. **Design**:
   - Design the database schema using MongoDB.
   - Create wireframes and mockups for the user interface.
   - Plan the architecture of the application.

3. **Development**:
   - Set up the development environment with Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and MongoDB.
   - Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
   - Develop the cab booking module.
   - Create the admin dashboard with necessary functionalities.
   - Integrate notification services for emails and SMS.

4. **Testing**:
   - Perform unit testing for individual components.
   - Conduct integration testing to ensure modules work together seamlessly.
   - Carry out user acceptance testing with a group of employees.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
   - Set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline.
   - Ensure the application is scalable and secure.

6. **Maintenance**:
   - Monitor the application for performance and security issues.
   - Provide regular updates and feature enhancements based on user feedback.
   - Offer technical support to users and administrators.

### Conclusion
This cab booking application aims to revolutionize the way employees book cabs within the company by leveraging the MERN stack's capabilities. By transitioning from a manual, offline process to an efficient online system, the application will enhance user satisfaction, reduce operational inefficiencies, and provide a robust solution for managing the company's internal cab service.

This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.
